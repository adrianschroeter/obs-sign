.SH NAME
sign.conf \- sign and signd configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/sign.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
This file holds the configuration both for the sign program and
the signd daemon. Each line in the file has the format
"key: value [value...]". Empty lines or lines starting with "#" are
ignored.

The following keys are recognized:

.TP 4
.BR server: " hostname"
Forward all unknown requests to the specified server.
.TP 4
.BR port: " port"
Use the specified port number instead of the default port "5167".
Also sets the proxyport.
.TP 4
.BR proxyport: " port"
Listen on the specified port number for incoming requests.
.TP 4
.BR user: " user"
Set a default user to use for signing.
.TP 4
.BR hash: " hash"
Set a default hash to use for signing. The default hash
is SHA1.
.TP 4
.BR allow: " ip subnet hostname..."
Allow only connections from the specified ip addresses,
subnets expressed in CIDR notation, and/or hostnames.
Note that hostnames are resolved using reverse DNS
lookups, so there must be reverse entries in the DNS
server, and it should be secured against DNS poisoning
attacks.
Must be present.
.TP 4
.BR gpg: " path_to_gpg"
Select the gpg program to use instead of "/usr/bin/gpg".
.TP 4
.BR phrases: " phrases_directory"
Set the directory containing gpg phrases for every user.
A phrase file is fed into gpg with the "--passphrase-fd=0"
option.
.TP 4
.BR map: " [hash:]from_signuser to_signuser"
Modify the signuser. This can be used to map hashes and
users to unambiguous key ids.
.TP 4
.BR allowuser: " username|uid"
Grant the user the right to sign. the sign binary must
be installed suid-root for this to work. Multiple
users can be specified by using multiple allowuser
lines in the configuration.
.TP 4
.BR allow-unprivileged-ports: " true|false"
Allow signd to accept connections from source ports >
1024.
Defaults to false.
.TP 4
.BR logfile: " filename"
Log requests to the specified filename instead of stdout.
.TP 4
.BR gnupghome: " dirname"
Configures the directory for gpg to use by setting the GNUPGHOME
environment variable.
.TP 4
.BR use-agent: " true|false"
Make signd directly talk to the gpg-agent for signing instead of
calling gpg. If the gpg command does not implement the --files-are-digest
parameter, this option always falls back to true.
.TP 4
.BR keycache: " dirname"
Cache the result of finding the signing key for a username. This
is only done if the gpg-agent is used for signing. The cache
is automatically invalidated if there is a change in the gpg
keyring.
.TP 4
.BR agentsocket: " socketpath [socketpath...]"
Specify the location of the gpg agent socket. It is possible to
specify more than one location, as gpg uses different socket
directories depending on if the user is logged in or not.
As a fallback, signd will call "gpgconf --list-dirs" to find
the current location of the agent socket.
