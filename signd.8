.SH NAME
signd \- execute or proxy sign requests

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B signd
.RB [ -f ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
signd is a little daemon that listens for sign requests from sign,
and either calls gpg to do the signing or forwards the request
to another signd server. The -f option makes signd fork on startup.

signd uses the same configuration used for sign, /etc/sign.conf.

.SH SECURITY
Unless the allow-unprivileged-ports option is set to true in
/etc/sign.conf, signd allows only connections from reserved ports
and the ip addresses, subnets expressed in CIDR notation, and
hostnames listed in the "allow" field of the configuration.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sign (8),
.BR sign.conf (5)
